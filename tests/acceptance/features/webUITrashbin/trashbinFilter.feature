Feature: Filter files/folders

  As a user
  I would like to filter files/folders
  So that I can make the file/folder list more clear

  Background:
    Given user "user1" has been created with default attributes
    And user "user1" has logged in using the webUI
    And the user has created the following files
      | entry_name        |
      | testFile          |
      | .simpleHiddenFile |
      | .hiddenTestFile   |
    And the user has created the following folders
      | entry_name          |
      | testFolder          |
      | .simpleHiddenFolder |
    And the following files have been deleted by user "user1"
      | name                |
      | lorem.txt           |
      | simple-folder       |
      | .simpleHiddenFile   |
      | .simpleHiddenFolder |
      | testFile            |
      | .hiddenTestFile     |
      | testFolder          |
    And the user has browsed to the trashbin page
